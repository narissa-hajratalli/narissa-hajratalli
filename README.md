### About Me 
After initially realizing Chemical Engineering wasn't the profession for me, I changed my major in college to Neuroscience on the pre-medical track. Even though I never truly had dreams of becoming a doctor, I have a desire to help others in profound ways. What did stick with me, was my interest in social impact and finding solutions to real-world problems. This is what led me to Software Engineering.

I am an engineer with 3 years of experience who always endeavors to absorb as much knowledge as possible and executes solutions to systemic problems with detail-oriented, thoughtful code. As a pre-medical student turned Software Engineer, I strive to code with the purpose to make other’s lives better. My “patient-first” perspective has seamlessly translated into a “user-first” approach when creating products that are geared towards societal impact. 
At my core, I am a leader who diagnoses problems efficiently and tackles them with a growth mindset.

In my free time, I create watercolor paintings, ceramic pieces, and interior design mood boards on Pinterest.
