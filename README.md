### About Me ###
After initially realizing Chemical Engineering wasn't the profession for me, I changed my major in college to Neuroscience on the pre-medical track. Even though I never truly had dreams of becoming a doctor, I have a desire to help others in profound ways. What did stick with me from my experience at NYU was my interest in social impact and finding solutions to real-world problems. This is what lead me to Software Engineering.

As a pre-medical student turned Software Engineer, I strive to code with the purpose to make other’s lives better. My “patient-first” perspective has seamlessly translated into a “user-first” approach when creating products that are geared towards societal impact. An ambitious problem-solver by nature, I always aim high to find solutions to systemic problems with detail-oriented, thoughtful code. At my core, I am a leader that diagnoses problems efficiently and tackles them with a growth mindset.

In my free time, I create watercolor paintings, ceramic pieces, and interior design mood boards on Pinterest.
