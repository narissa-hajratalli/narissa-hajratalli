### About Me 
After changing careers from the pre-medical track, I realized I never truly had dreams of becoming a doctor--I had a desire to help others in profound ways. What did stick with me, was my interest in social impact and finding solutions to real-world problems. This is what led me to Software Engineering.

I am a versatile engineer who always endeavors to absorb as much knowledge as possible and executes solutions to systemic problems with detail-oriented, thoughtful code. As a pre-medical student turned Software Engineer, I strive to code with the purpose to make other’s lives better. My “patient-first” perspective has seamlessly translated into a “user-first” approach when creating products that are geared towards societal impact. 
At my core, I am a leader who diagnoses problems efficiently and tackles them with a growth mindset.

In my free time, I like to dance, cook, take care of my plants, and create interior design mood boards on Pinterest :)
